Hi! I'm RazAPI, I love roblox exploiting and learning different programming languages ! ðŸš€ I'd love to learn: C++, C#, LuaU, Javascript, and more!
 I look forward into posting bypasses, executors for the people that cannot find them. I get the exploits from the actual discord server which if people are just too lazy to do that, Quiving already has a repository on SolaraB2. So go check that out if you do not trust my sources.
 Posting Bypasses like: Anti-AltDetection, Byfron Web Bypasses, Leaked Sources, & More!
 A universal repository for roblox exploiters!


 Questions that would possibly be asked: When did you start exploiting?

Mid 2020.

How long do you take into forwarding on Roblox Exploits?

More than 4 years i guess.

What do you like about roblox exploiting?

Unified Naming Convention Support, third party usage of debuggers, More types of stuff.


That's basically all.
